Introduction:

The lab is abot designing the algorithm for the coin change problem. We have to provide both the greedy and dynamic solutions. 

Approach:

Greedy: I have implemented the recursive greedy algorithm for this lab.
In greedy algorithm the algorithm works in such a way that at each step it chooses the closest denomination to the given inout amount
However since it does not cover the entire picture of the problem therefore it does not alawys return the optimal solution
however for the denomination {1,5,10,25} it returns the optimal solution.

Dynamic: the algorith implemented is iterative

it maintains a array c[] of optimal solution to given amount and uses it to produce a overall optimal solution in every case.
